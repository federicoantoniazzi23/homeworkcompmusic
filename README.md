Homework week 7
In the image you can see a graphic that I've made using the corpus that I've chosen to work on (discography of the italian band Espana Circo Este),
I've worked analyzing their four studio album, divide by colors, trying to see if there were any differences between each one of them, every dot represents a track, so we can see that tracks
from the album Macchu Pichu are more popular, and that Scienze della Maleducazione is their list succesful album in terms of popularity, also dancebility doesn't seems to have a huge impact on
popularity, alzo dot's sizes represent loudness, and we can see that the least popular songs are also the ones with a lower loudness
